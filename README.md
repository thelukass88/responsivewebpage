# responsivewebpage

## A webpage that uses @Mediaqueries to respond to different viewports

## Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Notes

I made this page twice with different display styles. Firstly, I tried grid. Whilst this was effective in making the website look nice, I struggled with the responsivness of grid. Whilst this is doable, I decided it would be easier to try flex. 

Flex was more challenging than grid to organise, but, far easier to code a Media Query into for screen responsiveness. 

## Unsolved

Elements I did not successfully complete:
1. Couldn't add 'a' tags to the images. I did this at the end of the process and found that adding 'a' tags changed the CSS and pushed the images out of position. As I was running out of time, I decided to add the 'a' tags to the divs containing the image titles, as this didn't impact their positioning.
2. Whilst the responsiveness is good, I felt that I struggled to get the H3 elements to move centrally when the viewport was reduced. 

## Credits

Thank you to Ramon Sanchez who helped me out by sending me links to useful YouTube clips on responsiveness. This really helped me to start again after my grid failure.
